# hello-world
trying to learn
* * i am currently learning i suppose
**and trying bold stlye**
>yeah i did the bold style but when i click preview it doesnt show like in the edit file i want it to be like in the edit file i dont know how if its even possible but i hope it is when i mean by it is edit file goes like 1 then 2 then 3 and it goes on but preview is just straight i dont want that
* there we go
1. i found the listing and thats with the numbers
- yep
-     i think pressing tab two times work better
-         it seems a lot further and i like it
-           and one time seems like this
-             but pressing one time looks better when there is so much nested lists
